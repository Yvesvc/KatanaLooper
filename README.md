The Katana Looper allows you to record your guitar playing and play it back in a loop.
Katana looper is a looping sofware that creates instant recordings of your guitar playing and plays those recordings back in real-time. This allows you to improvise on top of a repeating recording.

To be able to use the software, you need a Katana amp (although with a few minor tweaks it can work for any amp supporting ASIO), a USB B to A to connect your amp to the computer, and a guitar ;)

Here's how it works:
- Connect the amp to your computer
- Press the REC button and start playing your audio you want to have looped
- Press the REC button again to stop the recording. This creates the WAV file and the wave form.
- You can trim the recording to ensure the looping is smooth. You can also set a BPM value, this will help you determine the end of a loop.
- Now you can start playing back the loop by pressing the start button and release your inner Jimi Hendrix!

After playing, you can always save your recording and reload it later.
